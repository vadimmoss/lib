<p>In the project I used the Active Record design pattern. The Active Record scheme is an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped in classes. Thus, the object instance is bound to a single row in the table. After creating the object, a new row will be added to the table for saving. Any downloaded object receives its information from the database. When the object is updated, the corresponding row in the table will also be updated. The wrapper class implements access methods or properties for each column in the table or view.</p>
